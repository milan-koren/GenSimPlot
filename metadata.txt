about=GenSimPlot is a Python library and QGIS plugin that generates spatially optimized square, circular, rectangular, and elliptical plots for simulating and analyzing geographical processes. The plugin maximizes plot overlap with source polygons, supports regular grid point generation within plots, and enables extraction and assignment of environmental raster data to both simulation plots and points.
